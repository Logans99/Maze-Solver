# Maze-Solver

For this project, I developed a program that reads a representation of a maze and solves it. 
The goal of this project is to demonstrate that graphs can be used to model gain insight into
problems and chart a suitable solution for them. Graphs are built based on a relationship 
between entities. In the case of a graph, entities are squares that form the maze and the 
relationship is "is-adjacent-to".
